### Research Background

-   Host-parasite evolution is tightly intertwined

-   The parasites rely on hosts for their reproduction and development, but hosts are negatively impacted by the parasites

-   Parasites adapt to better infect their hosts, while hosts adapt to resist infection, leading to parallel evolutionary trajectories

-   It's expected that closely related parasites will infect closely related hosts

-   Haemosporidian parasites- parasites that infect blood cells

-   Malaria is spread from Haemosporidian parasites

-   Haemosporidians infect all major animal taxa

    -   define taxa

-   Haemosporidians are especially diverse in birds

-   While host-parasite relationships in haemosporidian parasites are well-known across most bird species, knowledge about those that infect vultures is still very limited

-   New World vultures are similar in appearance and in the functional role they play in the ecosystem as scavengers, but they have evolved unique physical and behavioral differences

-   Of the New World vultures, the turkey vultures (*Cathartes aura*) and black vultures (*Coragyps atratus*) are the most widespread, distributed from southern South America into the United States and even Canada in the case of the turkey vultures

-   Dr. Susan Perkins and colleagues set out to investigate the presence and diversity of haemosporidian parasites in turkey vultures and black vultures

-   @yabsley2018

-   They sampled blood and tissue from vultures in six US states

-   They extracted DNA from these samples and used a method called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify DNA strands that are known to be unique to haemosporidian parasites

-   They compared the number of haemosporidians detected in turkey vultures and black vultures, expecting haemosporidians to be present in the blood of both vulture species, since they play similar roles in the ecosystem

-   Using the extracted DNA and physical features of the parasites, they also sought to describe the evolutionary diversity of the sampled haemosporidians to see how it compared with existing knowledge of blood parasite evolutionary diversity

### Scientific Question

Do haemosporidians infect turkey vultures and black vultures equally?

### Excel exercise

Now you are going to take the data presented above and enter it into an Excel spreadsheet. Data entry, while often tedious, is an important skill that demands concentration and can be streamlined using techniques that I will demonstrate here.

#### Navigating Excel

You can navigate around Excel by clicking, or you can deftly maneuver around your spreadsheet using your keyboard. After clicking on a cell, you can use the left, right, up and down arrows (⬅️➡️⬆️⬇️) on your keyboard to navigate cell-by-cell in any of those directions. Where the true power of navigating with your keyboard comes in is through using `ctrl/cmd` + ⬅️➡️⬆️⬇️ to skip to the farthest extents of your spreadsheet instantly. For instance, starting with cell `A1` in the following spreadsheet:

![](images/clipboard-510028521.png)

Pressing `ctrl/cmd` + ➡️ immediately transfers you to cell `D1`.

![](images/clipboard-4089104628.png)

This is most powerful when combined with selecting ranges of data, which is outlined in the next section.

#### Selecting data

The most basic way to select a single cell is by clicking on the desired cell. To select multiple cells, you can use `ctrl/cmd + click`. You need to hold `ctrl/cmd` down for every cell that you click on to select all of them.

For instance, I held down `ctrl/cmd` and clicked on cells `A2`, `B3`, and `C2` in the following example.

![](images/clipboard-2879155544.png)

To select an entire column, click on the column letter. For instance, I clicked the column letter **B** to select **column B**. Note, the selection extends beyond the range of my data in the spreadsheet, which is normal.

![](images/clipboard-2108800815.png)

Similarly, to select a row in the spreadsheet, you should click on the row number. Here, I clicked on **row 4** to select the entire row.

![](images/clipboard-3264194476.png)

To select the whole spreadsheet, click on the triangle in the top-left corner of the spreadsheet.

![](images/leftcorner.png)

Finally, you can select ranges in the data using two main methods: the "click and drag" method and the keyboard method. But first, let's examine how a range of data is indicated. In the image below, the range of the selected data is `A1:C6`.

![](images/clipboard-2120102964.png)

The top left corner is indicated by the first index, while the bottom right corner is indicated by the second index.

The "click and drag" method is convenient for selecting moderate ranges of data, where you click on the cell where you want to begin, hold the click, and drag your mouse across the range of data that you would like to select. It's difficult to display in a static medium, so ask me if you're confused.

The keyboard method is useful for selecting a variety of ranges of data.

To select a small range of data, click on the cell where you want to begin, press `shift` and hold `shift` down while you navigate with your keyboard arrows. For instance, in the following example I clicked on cell `A1`, held `shift`, and pressed ➡️ twice to select the range `A1:C1`.

![](images/clipboard-709729488.png)

To select ranges of data that span to the edges of your data set, you will click on your desired starting point, hold `shift + ctrl/cmd`, and press a keyboard arrow. For instance, to select the range `B3:B8` in the following example, I clicked on `B3`, held `shift + ctrl/cmd`, then pressed ⬇️.

![](images/clipboard-2322803921.png)

The keyboard method is especially powerful as you combine keystrokes. For instance, I expanded the above selection to include the range `B3:D8` by pressing ➡️ while still holding down `shift + ctrl/cmd`.

![](images/clipboard-345859626.png)

You can even de-select data by pressing an arrow in the direction of the data you want to de-select. For instance, I de-selected the data in **column D** from the above selection by holding `shift` and pressing ⬅️.

![](images/clipboard-2890165928.png)

You can become a data selection wizard by combining the "click and drag" method with the keyboard method to rapidly navigate and choose the data you need!

#### Filling data

Filling data makes data entry much easier by filling ranges with values, so you don't have to type in every single value.

To learn about filling data, I will direct you to [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/excel/excel_filling.php), who provide an excellent introduction to the subject.

### Visualize the data

```{r}
#| label: data-plot

d %>% 
  mutate(PCR = as.factor(PCR),
         PCR = fct_relevel(PCR, "positive")) %>% 
  group_by(Species, PCR, .drop = FALSE) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x= Species, y = n, fill = PCR), position = "dodge")  +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#AD190B", "#FFEBDB"), labels = c("Yes", "No")) +
 # scale_alpha_manual(values = c(1.0, 0.6), guide = "none") +
  labs(y = "Count", fill = "Haemosporidian detected with PCR") +
  theme(legend.position = "top")

```

### Interpret the data

Based on the data - make a claim that answers the scientific question - What evidence was used to write your claim? - Explain your reasoning and why the evidence supports your claim

### Next steps as a scientist

-   Science is an ongoing process. What new question do you think should be investigated?
-   What future data should be collected to answer your question?
    -   Independent variables/dependent variables
-   For each variable, explain why you included it and how it could be measured
-   What hypothesis are you testing in your experiment?
