### Research Background

Parasites rely on hosts for their reproduction and development, but hosts are negatively impacted by this interaction. Over generations, parasites adapt to better infect their hosts, while hosts adapt to resist infection. This leads to tightly intertwined evolutionary trajectories, known as host-parasite co-evolution. When hosts and parasites evolve together, it's expected that closely related parasites will infect closely related hosts.

Haemosporidian (HEEM-OH-SPORE-IDIAN) parasites are a diverse group of parasites that infect blood cells. Included in this group is the genus *Plasmodium*, which transmit malaria. Their life cycle typically involves transmission to a host (e.g. humans or other vertebrate) by a vector (e.g. a mosquito), where the parasite develops in a body tissue like the liver before entering the blood stream and infecting blood cells.

While haemosporidians infect all major animal *taxa* (*taxa* are groups of organisms considered to be a unit, like "birds" or "mammals"), they are especially diverse with bird hosts. Host-parasite relationships in this group are well-known across most bird species, but knowledge about those that infect vultures is still very limited. That is why Dr. Susan Perkins and colleagues sought to understand the presence and diversity of haemosporidian parasites in vultures @yabsley2018.

There are two main vulture taxa- New World vultures and Old World vultures. New World vultures are distributed in the Western Hemisphere, while Old World vultures are distributed in the Eastern Hemisphere. Dr. Perkins focused on New World vultures. New World vulture species are similar in appearance and in the functional role they play in the ecosystem as scavengers, but they have evolved unique physical and behavioral differences. Of the New World vultures, the turkey vultures (*Cathartes aura*) and black vultures (*Coragyps atratus*) are the most widespread, distributed from southern South America into the United States and even Canada in the case of turkey vultures. This led Dr. Perkins and colleagues chose to focus on these two species for their study.

Dr. Perkins *et al.* (*et al.* is an abbreviation for "and others") sampled blood and tissue from 165 turkey vultures and 95 black vultures in six US states. A representative subset of this data is represented in the data table (Table 1) and map (Figure 1) below. They extracted DNA from these samples and used a method called [polymerase chain reaction (PCR)](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Polymerase-Chain-Reaction) to amplify DNA strands that are known to be unique to haemosporidian parasites. With this technique they are able to accurately identify if a particular vulture is infected with a haemosporidian parasite or not. Dr. Perkins *et al.* then compared the number of turkey vultures infected with haemosporidians with the number of infected black vultures. They expected haemosporidians to be present in the blood of both vulture species, since they are closely related and play similar roles in the ecosystem. Moreover, they expected a similar relative number of individuals to be infected in both species.

> Although you are not looking at this data today, they also used the DNA and physical features of the parasites to describe the evolutionary diversity of the sampled haemosporidians. They wanted to see how it compared with existing knowledge of blood parasite evolutionary diversity!

### Excel exercise

Data entry, while often tedious, is an important skill that demands concentration. However, there are techniques which can help you streamline the process! Below are techniques to quickly navigate and fill in data. These will help you with today's Excel assignment and all future data entry and analysis tasks!

#### Navigating an Excel sheet

The spreadsheet used for this exercise is [available for download here](https://github.com/connor-french/dss_2024/raw/main/data/w2_exercise.xlsx?dl=1).

You can navigate around your sheet by clicking, or you can deftly maneuver around your spreadsheet using your keyboard. After clicking on a cell, you can use the left, right, up and down arrows (⬅️➡️⬆️⬇️) on your keyboard to navigate cell-by-cell in any of those directions. Where the true power of navigating with your keyboard comes in is through using `ctrl/cmd` + ⬅️➡️⬆️⬇️ to skip to the farthest extents of your spreadsheet instantly. For instance, starting with cell `A1` in the following spreadsheet:

![](images/clipboard-510028521.png)

Pressing `ctrl/cmd` + ➡️ immediately transfers you to cell `D1`.

![](images/clipboard-4089104628.png)

This is most powerful when combined with selecting ranges of data, which is outlined in the next section.

#### Selecting data

The most basic way to select a single cell is by clicking on the desired cell. To select multiple cells, you can use `ctrl/cmd + click`. You need to hold `ctrl/cmd` down for every cell that you click on to select all of them.

For instance, I held down `ctrl/cmd` and clicked on cells `A2`, `B3`, and `C2` in the following example.

![](images/clipboard-2879155544.png)

To select an entire column, click on the column letter. For instance, I clicked the column letter **B** to select **column B**. Note, the selection extends beyond the range of my data in the spreadsheet, which is normal.

![](images/clipboard-2108800815.png)

Similarly, to select a row in the spreadsheet, you should click on the row number. Here, I clicked on **row 4** to select the entire row.

![](images/clipboard-3264194476.png)

To select the whole spreadsheet, click on the triangle in the top-left corner of the spreadsheet.

![](images/leftcorner.png)

Finally, you can select ranges in the data using two main methods: the "click and drag" method and the keyboard method. But first, let's examine how a range of data is indicated. In the image below, the range of the selected data is `A1:C6`.

![](images/clipboard-2120102964.png)

The top left corner is indicated by the first index, while the bottom right corner is indicated by the second index.

The "click and drag" method is convenient for selecting moderate ranges of data, where you click on the cell where you want to begin, hold the click, and drag your mouse across the range of data that you would like to select. It's difficult to display in a static medium, so ask me if you're confused.

The keyboard method is useful for selecting a variety of ranges of data.

To select a small range of data, click on the cell where you want to begin, press `shift` and hold `shift` down while you navigate with your keyboard arrows. For instance, in the following example I clicked on cell `A1`, held `shift`, and pressed ➡️ twice to select the range `A1:C1`.

![](images/clipboard-709729488.png)

To select ranges of data that span to the edges of your data set, you will click on your desired starting point, hold `shift + ctrl/cmd`, and press a keyboard arrow. For instance, to select the range `B3:B8` in the following example, I clicked on `B3`, held `shift + ctrl/cmd`, then pressed ⬇️.

![](images/clipboard-2322803921.png)

The keyboard method is especially powerful as you combine keystrokes. For instance, I expanded the above selection to include the range `B3:D8` by pressing ➡️ while still holding down `shift + ctrl/cmd`.

![](images/clipboard-345859626.png)

You can even de-select data by pressing an arrow in the direction of the data you want to de-select. For instance, I de-selected the data in **column D** from the above selection by holding `shift` and pressing ⬅️.

![](images/clipboard-2890165928.png)

You can become a data selection wizard by combining the "click and drag" method with the keyboard method to rapidly navigate and choose the data you need!

#### Filling data

Filling data makes data entry much easier by filling ranges with values, so you don't have to type in every single value.

To learn about filling data, I will direct you to [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/excel/excel_filling.php), who provide an excellent introduction to the subject.

#### Excel assignment

<mark>**4. *Take the table of data used in Dr. Susan Perkin's study (Table 1) and enter it into an Excel workbook.*** </mark> Use the skills you learned today to make this task easier! Upload the spreadsheet to Blackboard before the next lab period.

### Data analysis

There are two main approaches to interpreting quantitative data- data visualization and statistics. You will learn some basic statistics in future labs, but for now you will focus on interpreting data visualizations.

```{r}
#| label: data-plot
#| fig-cap: "Figure 2. Bar plot of the number of sampled vultures for each species that were detected with haemosporidians or were not."

d %>% 
  mutate(PCR = as.factor(PCR),
         PCR = fct_relevel(PCR, "positive")) %>% 
  group_by(Species, PCR, .drop = FALSE) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x= Species, y = n, fill = PCR), position = "dodge")  +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#AD190B", "#FFEBDB"), labels = c("Yes", "No")) +
 # scale_alpha_manual(values = c(1.0, 0.6), guide = "none") +
  labs(y = "Count", fill = "Haemosporidian detected with PCR") +
  theme(legend.position = "top")

```

### Interpret the data

<mark>**5.** ***Based on the bar plot above, what can you say about your hypothesis? Is it supported or not supported? Why?***</mark>

### Next steps as a scientist

Science is never finished. Every answer leads to new questions, and perhaps more importantly to remember, not every answer is the final answer. Keeping this in mind,

<mark>**6. *What new question do you think should be investigated and why? If the new question requires new data, what data should be collected and why?***</mark>
