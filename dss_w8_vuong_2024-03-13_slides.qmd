::: notes
I will be recording attendance for the remainder of the semester- I talked with Dr. Lohman and he agrees that we both need to keep track of attendance to make sure we're able to assess the progress of everyone in the class and reach out if people are struggling. I'm not adding a lab attendance grade, but Dave might use lab attendance in his course attendance grade.
